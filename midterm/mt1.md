# Midterm 1 Notes

## Static/Dynamic Types
* Dynamic type usually always stays same
* Static type can be changed via assignment & casting, but doesn't modify dynamic type

## Polymorphism
* Methods can return subclasses of their declared type & take in arguments that are subclasses of declared parameter types
