# [3.2 Binary Search Trees](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/32bst/)
* In a *binary search tree*, each node has key & value, w/ ordering restriction to support efficient search
* ***Binary search tree (BST):*** Binary tree where each node has `Comparable` key (& associated value) & satisfies restriction that key in any node is larger than keys in all nodes in node's left subtree & smaller than keys in all nodes in node's right subtree

## Basic Implementation
* BST represents *set* of keys (& associated values)
    * $$\exists$$ many different BSTs that represent same set

## Analysis
* Assume keys (uniformly) *random* → inserted in random order
    * BSTs dual to quicksort
    * Node at root of tree = first partitioning item in quicksort (no keys to left larger, no keys to right smaller)
    * Subtrees built recursively, corresponds to quicksort's recursive subarray sorts
* Adding depths of all nodes = ***internal path length*** of tree
* Search hits in BST built from $$N$$ random keys require $$\sim 2 \ln{N}$$ compares, on average
    * $$C_{N}$$ = total internal path length of BST built from inserting $$N$$ randomly ordered distinct keys
    * $$C_{N} \sim 2 N \ln{N}$$
* Insertions & search misses in BST built from $$N$$ random keys require $$\sim 2 \ln{N}$$ compares, on average
    * Insertions and search misses take 1 more compare, on average, than search hits
    * $$E = I + 2n$$
        * $$E$$ = external path length
        * $$I$$ = internal path length
        * $$n$$ = # of internal nodes
        * Need at least 1 extra up from $$I$$ for each node w/ at least 1 external child → if is leaf node w/ 2 external children, have to count second child by tracing nodes down from root → need $$2n$$ extra up from $$I$$
        * Can consider recursively/inductively as well
    * \# of empty links or external nodes $$\approx n$$ → $$\frac{C_{N} + n}{n} = \frac{C_{n}}{n} + 1$$ → need to add 1 for root comparison → $$\frac{C_{n}}{n} + 2$$
    * Like quicksort, standard deviation of # of compares known to be low → formulas increasingly accurate as $$N$$ ↑

## Order-based Methods & Deletion
* Important reason BSTs widely used b/c allow *keeping keys in order* → basis for implementing ordered symbol-table API

### Floor & Ceiling
* Floor of key = largest key in BST $$\leq$$ `key`
    * If given key `key` $$<$$ key at root of BST → floor of `key` *must* be in left subtree
    * If `key` $$>$$ key at root → floor of `key` *could* be in right subtree
        * In right subtree only if $$\exists$$ key $$\leq$$ `key` in right subtree
        * If not (or if `key` = key at root) → key at root = floor of `key`
* Interchanging right & left (and $$<$$ & $$>$$, $$\leq$$ & $$\geq$$) = `ceiling()`

### Delete
* Choice of using only successor as replacement = arbitrary & not symmetric
* Worthwhile to choose at random between predecessor & successor

### Analysis
* Given tree → height determines worst-case of all BST operations (except range search, which incurs additional cost proportional to # of keys returned)
* Average height of BST built from random keys logarithmic → approaches $$2.99 \lg{N}$$ for large $$N$$
* BST & quicksort both rely on randomization for optimal performance
    * Worst case for both when input is in (reverse) sorted order
