# Case Study: Union-Find

## Dynamic Connectivity
* "Is connected to" = ***equivalence*** relation:
    * ***Reflexive:*** `p` is connected to `p`
    * ***Symmetric:*** If `p` connected to `q` → `q` connected to `p`
    * ***Transitive:*** If `p` connected to `q` & `q` connected to `r` → `p` connected to `r`
* Equivalence relation partitions objects into ***equivalence classes***
    * 2 objects in same equivalence class iff connected
