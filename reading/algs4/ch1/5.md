# [1.5 Case Study: Union-Find](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/15uf/)

## Dynamic Connectivity
* "Is connected to" = ***equivalence*** relation:
    * ***Reflexive:*** `p` is connected to `p`
    * ***Symmetric:*** If `p` connected to `q` → `q` connected to `p`
    * ***Transitive:*** If `p` connected to `q` & `q` connected to `r` → `p` connected to `r`
* Equivalence relation partitions objects into ***equivalence classes***
    * 2 objects in same equivalence class iff connected

## Implementations

### Weighted Quick-Union
* Keep track of *size* of each tree & always connect smaller tree to larger

### Weighted Quick-Union Analysis
* Worst case input = when sizes of trees to be merged by `union()` always equal (and power of 2)
    * Height of such worst case input tree of $$2^{n}$$ nodes = $$n$$
* When merging 2 trees of $$2^{n}$$ nodes → get tree of $$2^{n + 1}$$ nodes → increase height of tree to $$n + 1$$
    * Generalizes to provide proof that weighted algorithm can guarantee *logarithmic* performance
* Weighted quick-union algorithm uses *at most* $$c M \lg{N}$$ array accesses to process $$M$$ connections among $$N$$ sites for small constant $$c$$
    * Quick-find (& sometimes quick-union) uses *at least* $$MN$$ array accesses

**Performance Characteristics of Union-Find Algorithms**

| Algorithm        | Constructor | `union` | `find` |
|:----------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:------:|
| ***impossible*** | $$N$$       | 1       | 1      |

### Optimal Algorithms
* Weighted quick union w/ path compression optimal, but not quite constant-time per operation
    * $$\exists$$ *no* algorithm that can guarantee to perform each union-find operation in amortized constant time
    * Weighted quick-union w/ path compression very close to best we can do for dynamic connectivity problem

## Q & A
* ***Cell-probe model:*** Model of computation, only count accesses to random-access memory large enough to hold input
    * Consider all other operations to be free
