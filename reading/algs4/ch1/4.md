# [1.4 Analysis of Algorithms](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/14analysis/)

## Mathematical Models
* Most often, work w/ tilde approximations of form $$g(N) \sim af(N)$$ where $$f(N) = N^{b} (\log{N})^{c}$$, w/ $$a, b, c$$ constants
    * Refer to $$f(N)$$ as ***order of growth*** of $$g(N)$$

### Approximate Running Time
* Only instructions executed most frequently play role in final total → ***inner loop*** of program
* Typical behavior: running times of many programs depend only on small subset of instructions

### Analysis of Algorithms
* Order of growth significant b/c relates abstract world of Java program to real world of computer running it
* Working w/ order of growth separates program from algorithm it implements → abstracts away unnecessary details (e.g. programming language, computer)
* *Algorithm* (and sometimes input model) determines order of growth
* Separating algorithm from implementation on particular computer powerful b/c allows for development of knowledge about performance of algorithms → can then be applied to any computer

### Cost Model
* ***Cost model*** defines basic operations used by algorithms to solve problem at hand (e.g. # of array accesses)
* W/ cost model, can make precise mathematical statements about properties of an algorithm, not just particular implementation
* Articulate cost models such that order of growth of running time for given implementation same as order of growth of cost of underlying algorithm
    * Cost model should include operations that fall w/in inner loop
* Precise mathematical results about algorithms (propositions)
* Hypotheses about performance of implementations (properties) verifiable through experimentation

### Summary
* For many programs, developing mathematical model of running time reduces to:
    * Develop ***input model***, including definition of problem size
    * Identify ***inner loop***
    * Define ***cost model*** that includes operations in inner loop
    * Determine frequency of execution of operations for given input

## Caveats

### Large Constants
* Leading-term approximations ignore constant coefficients in lower-order terms, may not be justified
* When approximating $$2N^{2} + cN$$ w/ $$\sim 2N^{2}$$ → assume $$c$$ small
    * If $$c$$ not small (e.g. $$c$$ is $$10^{3}$$ or $$10^{6}$$), approximation is misleading
* Have to be sensitive to possibility of large constants

### Nondominant Inner Loop
* Assumption that inner loop dominates not always correct
* Cost model may miss true inner loop, or problem size $$N$$ not large enough to make leading term in mathematical description of frequency of execution of instructions in inner loop so much larger than lower-order terms (making them negligible)
* Some programs have significant amount of code outside inner loop → needs to be taken into consideration
    * Cost model may need to be refined

### Instruction Time
* Assumption that each instruction takes same amount of time not always correct
* ***Caching*** memory organization → accessing elements in huge arrays can take much longer if not close together in array

### Amortized Analysis
* \# array entries accessed for $$N$$ consecutive insertions into resizing array = $$N + 4 + 8 + 16 + \ldots + 2N = 5N - 4$$
* *Average # of array accesses per operation* constant
* Algorithm input not just data, but sequence of operations performed by client → amortized analysis provides worst-case performance guarantee on sequence of operations
