# [4.4 Shortest Paths](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/44sp/)

## Properties of Shortest Paths
* Strongly connected = every vertex reachable from every other vertex
* Shortest paths normally simple
    * Zero-weight edges that form cycles ignored → shortest paths found have no cycles
* Shortest paths not necessarily unique
    * May be multiple paths of lowest weight from one vertex to another, content to find any one of them
* Parallel edges & self-loops may be present
    * Only lowest-weight among set of parallel edges plays role, no shortest path contains self-loop (except possibly one of zero weight → ignored)
