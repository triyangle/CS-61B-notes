# 2.5 The AList

## ALists
### Memory Performance
* Usage ratio `R = size / items.length`
    * Halve size of array when `R < .25`

### Generic ALists
* Java does not allow creating of array of generic objects
    * Can't do `items = new Glorp[8];`
    * Have to cast w/ `items = (Glorp[]) new Object[8];` instead
