# 2.1 Mystery of the Walrus

## Lists
* 72 and letter H both stored as 01001000
* Java interprets 01001000 differently via types

```java
char c = 'H';
int x = c;
System.out.println(c); // H
System.out.println(x); // 72
```
outputs
```
H
72
```

## Declaring a Variable (Simplified)
* When declaring variable of certain type, Java finds contiguous block of exactly enough bits to hold thing of that type
    * Declaring `int` → block of 32 bits
    * Declaring `byte` → block of 8 bits
* Each data type in Java holds different # of bits
* In addition to setting aside memory, Java interpreter also creates entry in internal table mapping each variable name to location of first bit in box
* Java provides no way to find out location of box (e.g. can't find out at which bit variable's value begins)
    * Exact memory address below level of abstraction accessible in Java
        * Unlike C, in which one can ask for exact address of piece of data
    * Feature of Java = tradeoff
        * Hiding memory locations gives less control → prevents certain types of optimizations
        * Also avoids large class of tricky programming errors
* Java does not write anything into reserved box when variable is declared, no default values
    * Compiler prevents usage of variable until after box has been filled w/ bits using `=` operator
* When assigning values to memory box, it is filled w/ bits specified


## Reference Types

### Object Instantiation
* When _instantiating_ Object using `new` (e.g. `Dog`, `Walrus`, `Planet`), Java first allocates box for each instance variable of class, & fills them w/ default value
    * Constructor usually fills every box w/ some other value
