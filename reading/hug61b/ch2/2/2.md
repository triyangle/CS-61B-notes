# 2.2 The SLList

## SLLists

### Improvement #4: Nested Classes
* If nested class has no need to use any of instance methods/variables of `SLList`, may declared nested class as `static`
    * Declaring nested class as `static` → methods inside static nested class cannot access instance members of enclosing class
    * Results in small savings of memory b/c each `IntNode` no longer needs to keep track of how to access enclosing `SLList`

#### Overloading Methods
* Method signature = method name & parameter types
* Can't declare more than one method w/ same name & same # & type of args b/c compiler can't tell them apart
    * Compiler doesn't consider return type when differentiating methods → can't declare 2 methods w/ same signature even if they have different return type
